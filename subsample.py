4.	We must synchronize the timestamp of the accelerometer data with the video 
that details to behavioural observations of the dog. At the beginning of the 
observation period, we performed conspicuous calibration tilts (the device was 
rotated 90 degrees for 5 second, and this was repeated 3 times). With this in mind, 
use subsample.py to plot 10-minute summaries of the data. The function will run through 
the first 3 days of the file (after that the tag was off the animal and so it's just 
excess data), showing a 10 minute window in each plot to help you find the calibration 
tilts mentioned previously. This function needs there to be a folder called 'explore', 
which will be filled with plots for you to run through sequentially (using Windowsâ€™ Photo 
app for instance). In future, we will implement a more elegant interactive plot for Users 
to use in Python, but this is currently in development. Once the tilts are identified and 
their time in the accelerometer file noted, you can trim the start of the file to ca. 5 seconds 
before the tilts, to make them easy to spot and sync to the video in ELAN.
